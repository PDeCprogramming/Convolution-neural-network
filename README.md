The code provided includes programs to create a dataset and trained convolutional neural network (training.py) which is trained upon an mnist dataset (a large set of hand-drawn digits). Then, there is also a drawing application () which opens a window when run that allows you to draw your own numbers, and a button to tell the AI to predict what you have drawn, which also gives a new window showing the processed image, or sort of like what the AI can see, and then provides the prediction.
